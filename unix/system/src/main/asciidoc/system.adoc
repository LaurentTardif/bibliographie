== Install a NFS server

=== On ubuntu 

.on the server

 sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

Then we can create the repository to share, and change owner 

 sudo mkdir /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data
 sudo chown nobody:nogroup  /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data
 sudo chmod ugo+wx /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data/

 
Then we can configure the /etc/exports to define shared mount points

 # /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
 #               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
 #
 # Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
 # /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
 #
 # Example for NFSv4:
 # /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
 # /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
 #
 /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data 10.0.0.6(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
 /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data 10.0.0.7(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Quick summary of permissions 

 * rw: This option gives the client computer both read and write access to the volume.
 * sync: This option forces NFS to write changes to disk before replying. This results in a more stable and consistent environment since the reply reflects the actual state of the remote volume. However, it also reduces the speed of file operations.
 * no_subtree_check: This option prevents subtree checking, which is a process where the host must check whether the file is actually still available in the exported tree for every request. This can cause many problems when a file is renamed while the client has it opened. In almost all cases, it is better to disable subtree checking.
 * no_root_squash: By default, NFS translates requests from a root user remotely into a non-privileged user on the server. This was intended as security feature to prevent a root account on the client from using the file system of the host as root. no_root_squash disables this behavior for certain shares.


 
.on the client

 sudo apt-get install nfs-common

Then we prepare nfs mount points

 sudo mkdir -p /nfs/artifactory_data
 
.check that's working

On the server side :

 echo "HelloWorld"  > /nfs/artifactory_data/Readme.txt

on the client side :
 
 ls /nfs/artifactory_data
