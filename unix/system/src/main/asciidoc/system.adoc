== Install a NFS server

=== On ubuntu 

.on the server

 sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

Then we can create the repository to share, and change owner 

 sudo mkdir /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data
 sudo chown nobody:nogroup  /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data
 sudo chmod ugo+wx /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data/

 
Then we can configure the /etc/exports to define shared mount points

 # /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
 #               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
 #
 # Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
 # /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
 #
 # Example for NFSv4:
 # /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
 # /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
 #
 /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data 10.0.0.6(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
 /sharedDirectoy/artifactory_data 10.0.0.7(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

Quick summary of permissions 

 * rw: This option gives the client computer both read and write access to the volume.
 * sync: This option forces NFS to write changes to disk before replying. This results in a more stable and consistent environment since the reply reflects the actual state of the remote volume. However, it also reduces the speed of file operations.
 * no_subtree_check: This option prevents subtree checking, which is a process where the host must check whether the file is actually still available in the exported tree for every request. This can cause many problems when a file is renamed while the client has it opened. In almost all cases, it is better to disable subtree checking.
 * no_root_squash: By default, NFS translates requests from a root user remotely into a non-privileged user on the server. This was intended as security feature to prevent a root account on the client from using the file system of the host as root. no_root_squash disables this behavior for certain shares.


 
.on the client

 sudo apt-get install nfs-common

Then we prepare nfs mount points

 sudo mkdir -p /nfs/artifactory_data
 
.check that's working

On the server side :

 echo "HelloWorld"  > /nfs/artifactory_data/Readme.txt

on the client side :
 
 ls /nfs/artifactory_data 

== Install prostgres server

 sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

 * Default user is postgres
 * command line is psql
 * default port 5432
 * configuration of remote access : vi /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf 
	
 host    all             all             10.0.0.1/32            md5

 * configuration of listening address and ports  vi /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/postgresql.conf

  listen_addresses = 'localhost,10.0.0.6'

  
== SSH multiplexing

The easiest way to configure your system to use single ssh sessions by default with multiplexing.

This can be done by creating a folder for the sockets:

mkdir ~/.ssh/controlmasters

And then adding the following to your .ssh configuration:

Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%r@%h:%p.socket
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPersist 10m

Now, you do not need to modify any of your code. This allows multiple calls to ssh and scp without creating multiple sessions, which is useful when there needs to be more interaction between your local and remote machines.
