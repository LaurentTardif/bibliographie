== Data modelling

 Data modeling is a process that involves	

 * Collection and analysis of data requirements in an information system	
 * Identiﬁcation of participating entities and relationships among them	
 * Identiﬁcation of data access patterns 	
 * A particular way of organizing and structuring data	
 * Design and speciﬁcation of a database schema	
 * Schema optimization and data indexing techniques 
 
=== Key steps

Understand data and application queries	

 * Data may or may not exist in some format (RDBMS, XML, CSV, …)	
  * Queries can be organized into a query graph	
 *  Design column families 	
  * Design is based on access patterns or queries over data	
 * Implement the design using CQL	
  * Optimizations concerning data types, keys, partition sizes, ordering	

=== Modeling data

 * Modeling principle 1: “Know your data”
 * Key and cardinality constraints are fundamental to schema design
 * Modeling principle 2: “Know your queries”
 * Queries drive schema design
 * Modeling principle 3: “Nest data”
 * Data nesting is the main data modeling technique
 * Modeling principle 4: “Duplicate data”
 * Better to duplicate than to join
