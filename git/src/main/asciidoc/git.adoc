== Introduction 

quick start on git 
From 

 * http://www.tecmint.com/install-nagios-in-linux/
 *

 == Remote
 
 === idea 
 
   share code easily among two people
   avoid remote server connection
   
=== example

Simple example of workflow :

 * one personn clone a remote, do some change
 * someonelse get the change locally, and push it to master

== Worktree 

=== idea 
There are legitimate reasons why you may want/need multiple worktrees in the filesystem at once.

 * manipulating the checked out files while needing to make changes somewhere else (eg. compiling/testing)
 * diffing the files via normal diff tools
 * during merge conflicts, I often want to navigate through the source code as it is on source side while resolving conflicts in the files.
 * If you need to switch back and forth a lot, there is wasted time checkout out and rechecking out that you don't need to do with multiple worktrees.
 * the mental cost of mental context switching between branches via git stashing is not really measurable. Some people find that there is mental cost to stashing that isn't there by simply opening files from a different directory.

=== examples

I tried this out locally.

....
    create a directory page1.
    inside create the directory src and git init it.
    in src create and add commit page1.html with a little content.

    $ git branch ver0
    $ git worktree add ../V0 ver0
    in src master add more text to page1.html and add commit it.
    $ git branch sty1
    edit page1.html in the sty1 branch (add some distinctive CSS style) and add commit it.
    $ git worktree add ../S1 sty1
	
You can now use a web browser to open and view these 3 versions simultaneously:

    ..\page1\src\page1.html // whatever git has as current
    ..\page1\V0\page1.html // the initial version
    ..\page1\S1\page1.html // the experimentally styled version
....


=== Add / delete 

To create a new worktree for a specific branch 
....
#create a new worktree in the repository foo_V0 using branch V0
git worktree add ..\foo_VO v0
....

To delete it (no direct deletion), need to delete the repository physically, then prune it

....
C:\tmp\foo>git worktree list
C:/tmp/foo     2eaa4c9 [master]
C:/tmp/foo_V0  b46dc05 [v0]

#(delete it physically)
C:\tmp\foo>rmdir /S ..\foo_v0
C:\tmp\foo>git worktree prune

#the worktree have been removed
C:\tmp\foo>git worktree list
C:/tmp/foo  2eaa4c9 [master]

....


=== TIPS

 * can not have a branch at the same time in the main repository and in a worktree
